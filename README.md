# ENDS
The Epistemic Nonparametric Drug-response Scoring

#### Welcome to the ENDS ...

Mainly tailored on nonparameteric paradigm, the ***ENDS*** is a visualization and comparative drug-response curve fitting tool.

The data can be uploaded into the program in a *.csv* format. Nonparametric Spline (*npS*), nonparametric Monotonic (*npM*) and nonparametric Bayesian (*npB*) and parametric Logistic (*pL*) models are fit to the data. Each model computes its effective dose at 50% area under the curve and Mean Square Errors (MSE) for comparison. For the *npS* model we have several arithmetic measures provided to guide the expert in their elucidation from the data. ENDS also provides an option for fitting the four-parameter conventional log-logistic fit (*pL*) and possibility to download the obtained fits for each model as well as novel indices and statistics.
