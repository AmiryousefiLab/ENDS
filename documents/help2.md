It is possible to go to the **Example** tab in **Fit** and choose between different drug-patient characteristics. This dataset comes from ["Intra-tumour diversification in colorectal cancer at the single-cell level"](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0024-3).

Once the drug-response data is uploaded or the selected drug-patient characterics are selected, click the **Plot** button to compile the graph. 

### 2. Plot options

The plot has the following options:

**Models**

- **Nonparametric Spline:** Simple linear spline connecting the mean responses. 

- **Parametric Logistic:** The usual four paramter logistic model fit by weighted least squares to the data. 
- **Nonparametric Monotonic:** Is the nonparametric spline with a non increasing contraint added, by taking recursively the means of the previous responses until the trend in negative.
- **Nonparametric Bayesian:** Specifies a bayesian hierarchical model which fits a collection of normal cumulative distribution functions centered at the doses as the basis function of a spline fit.

**Plot Layers**

- **Point samples:** If dataset consists of multiple samples, this are shown in plot
- **Min-max bands (MMB):** Linear connection of the maximum values for each dose. Same for minimum values.
- **Empirical viability band (EVB):** It is generated by connecting the sides of the step function generted by the adjacent mean lines, which are the horizontal line that at the mean of each consecuentent pair of responses. It is used to visualize the variability of the samples within this bands.
- **Drug span gradient (DSG):** It is the linear regression fit over the mean responses,  the gradient angle is given in the plot.
- **Absolute and relative doses:** The angle of each of the spline fits are the absolute doses, the most effective dose is the one with the most smallest angle. We can aslo compare each individual angle with the *drug span gradient* to determine if each dose is more effective than the overall trend, if it is more steep then we say it is a *Possitive Relative Dose* (PRD) otherwise it is a *Negative Relative Dose*. The Concave Ratio (CR) is defined $CR = \#PRD/\#NRD$​​​​.

**Data Processing**

- **Median/Mean:**  Mean or the median of the responses at that dose, by default it is mean. 
- **Outliers Kept:** If not selected then samples outside of 2 standarad deviations from mean are removed from data. 
- **Viability over 100:** If not selected then values above 100 are replaced to be 100.
- **Dose dependent AUC:** If not selected then AUC is calculated with a sequence of integers from 1 to the number of samples as the x-values, else with the doses as the x-values. AUC is the area under the curve fitted by the corresponding model.
