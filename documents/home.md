#### Welcome to the ENDS ...

The ***ENDS*** is a visualization and comparative tool for parametric and nonparametric drug-response fitting models. 

Data can be uploaded into the interface in a *.csv* file. Nonparametric spline, nonparametric monotonic and nonparametric bayesian and parametric logistic models are fit onto the data. Each model computes its effective dose at 50% area under the curve and mean square error for comparison. For the nonparametric spline model we have several statistical measure provided to guide the hand of the expert such as the most effective dose and drug response gradient. A parametric model assumes a specific shape for the adjusted function, we encourane the user to compare the fit provided from the parametric model to the nonparametric approach.
