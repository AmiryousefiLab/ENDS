#### Welcome to the ENDS ...

Mainly tailored on nonparametric paradigm, the ***ENDS*** is a visualisation and comparative drug-response curve fitting tool.

The data can be uploaded into the program in a *.csv* format. Nonparametric Spline (*npS*), nonparametric Monotonic (*npM*) and nonparametric Bayesian (*npB*) and parametric Logistic (*pL*) models are fit to the data. Each model computes its effective dose at 50% area under the curve and Mean Square Errors (MSE) for comparison. For the *npS* model we have several arithmetic measures provided to guide the expert in their elucidation from the data. ENDS also provides possibility of comparing multiple drugs and downloading the obtained fits and statistics.
